                Kerala has 14 separate districts, each famous for its own set of
                unique destinations and features: Thiruvananthapuram, Kollam,
                Alappuzha, Pathanamthitta, Kottayam, Idukki, Ernakulam,
                Thrissur, Palakkad, Malappuram, Kozhikode, Wayanad, Kannur and
                Kasaragod.
                <br /><br />
                On the basis of geographical, historical and cultural
                similarities, the districts are generally grouped into North
                Kerala (Kasaragod, Kannur, Wayanad, Kozhikode, Malappuram) ,
                Central Kerala (Palakkad, Thrissur, Eranakulam, Idukki) and
                South Kerala (Thiruvananthapuram, Kollam, Alappuzha,
                Pathanamthitta, Kottayam).The districts have the same name as
                the important town or city in the district, the exception being
                Wayanad district.

                  Located in the southwestern tip of India, Thiruvananthapuram
                  is bound by the Arabian Sea in the west and Tamil Nadu in the
                  east. Named after Anantha Padmanabha or Lord Vishnu, the city
                  is home to many ancient temples. But the landmark is the Sree
                  Padmanabha Swamy Temple around which the city has been built
                  on seven low hills. The wooded highlands of the Western Ghats
                  in the eastern and northeastern borders give
                  Thiruvananthapuram some of the most enchanting picnic spots. A
                  long shoreline with internationally renowned beaches, historic
                  monuments, backwater stretches and a rich cultural heritage
                  make this district a much sought-after tourist destination.
                  Clean and green, Thiruvananthapuram, the capital of Kerala is
                  one of the most beautiful cities in the country.

                  One of the premier trade capitals of the Old World, Kollam is
                  the centre of the country’s cashew trading and processing
                  industry. Extolled by Marco Polo and Ibn Batuta in glowing
                  terms, this was once a famous port of international spice
                  trade. This historic town is home to the celebrated Ashtamudi
                  Lake, making it a gateway to the breath-taking backwaters of
                  Kerala. The eight-hour boat trip between Kollam and Alappuzha
                  is the longest and most enchanting experience on the
                  backwaters of Kerala. The momentous decision to introduce a
                  new Malayalam era was convened at Kollam and hence the
                  Malayalam calendar came to be known as Kollavarsham.

                  A hilly province of pristine splendour, the district of
                  Pathanamthitta is hailed as the headquarters of pilgrim
                  worship in Kerala. Three rivers course through its prosperous
                  terrains comprising natural divisions of the lowlands, the
                  midlands and the highlands. Interspersed with temples, rivers,
                  mountain ranges and coconut groves, more than fifty per cent
                  of the total area of this region is covered by forests.
                  Pathanamthitta has been dubbed a Heritage Village as it
                  attracts visitors from all over the world for its spectacular
                  water fiestas, religious shrines and cultural training
                  centres. Pathanamthitta is also home to the unique
                  AranmulaKannadi - metal mirrors that are meticulously
                  handcrafted and the VasthuVidyaGurukulam, a village which
                  practices the ancient Indian school of architecture.

                  Affectionately nicknamed the 'Venice of the East' by
                  travellers from across the world, Alappuzha is a district of
                  immense natural beauty. Embraced by the Arabian Sea in the
                  west and a network of lakes, lagoons and freshwater rivers
                  criss-crossing it, this backwater country is home toa vibrant
                  animal and avian life. By virtue of its proximity to the sea,
                  the town has always carved out an exclusive place for itself
                  in the maritime history of Kerala. Renowned for its boat
                  races, beaches, marine products and coir industry, the
                  singularity of this land is the region called Kuttanad. A land
                  of lush paddy fields referred to as the 'Rice Bowl of Kerala',
                  it is one of the few places in the world where farming is done
                  below sea level. This once prosperous trading and fishing
                  centre is nowadays a world renowned backwater tourist
                  destination.

                  Kottayam district is famous for its rich heritage and literary
                  tradition. It is renowned for its spice and rubber trade.
                  Cradled by the backwaters and the Western Ghats, it is
                  epitomised by its stretches of vast greenery, paddy fields and
                  huge rubber plantations. Over five of the State’s leading
                  newspaper publications originate from Kottayam. About
                  four-fifth of books published in the State come from here as
                  well. From trekking hotbeds like Nadukani and Kottathavalam to
                  the rare avian life on display at the Kumarakom Bird
                  Sanctuary, this district encompasses everything that God’s Own
                  Country is famous for. Well connected to the entire State, it
                  is full of interesting historical and cultural locations that

                  Idukki is Kerala's second largest district and has been
                  blessed with numerous natural wonders. The high valleys and
                  hill ranges of this landlocked region are fed by three major
                  rivers - Periyar, Thalayar and Thodupuzhayar and their
                  tributaries. Its forest still hosts many tribes and over half
                  of the terrain is still covered with forests. People love
                  going to the gigantic arch dam for getting its mesmerising
                  view. Blessed with a wide range of trekking trail, each of
                  them offers a spectacular view of the valley below and ranges
                  above of Idukki. The place is also renowned for its exotic
                  flora and fauna and one can come across many rare species
                  while visiting Idukki.

                  Ernakulam is a sprawling metropolis that beautifully combines
                  its natural wonders with providing a base for a majority of
                  the State’s business enterprises. Flanked by the Arabian sea,
                  it is easily among the most visited locations in Kerala. It is
                  an extremely important commercial centre but also has a
                  plethora of destinations for tourists to enjoy. The city of
                  Kochi, with its fine natural harbour, is the undisputed crown
                  jewel of the district. From historic locations that transport
                  you to a time when it acted as the commercial hub of the
                  legendary Spice Route to exotic trips on boats where one can
                  simply relax and soak in the weather, Kochi never disappoints.
                  Ernakulam has always epitomized the Malayali spirit of
                  welcoming all who visit it and this tradition continues to
                  this day.

                  Celebrated as the Granary of Kerala, Palakkad is a vast
                  stretch of fertile plains interspersed with hills, rivers,
                  mountain streams and forests. The gateway to Kerala from the
                  north, a 40 kilometre break in the mountains known as the
                  Palakkad Gap gives access to this land situated at the foot of
                  the Western Ghats. The pass acts as a corridor between Kerala
                  and the neighbouring Tamil Nadu and played a key role in the
                  trade relations between the east and west coasts of peninsular
                  India. Deriving its name from the Malayalam words Pala
                  (Alsteriascholaris) and Kadu (forest), this place was once a
                  stunning expanse of forest covered with the sweet-scented
                  flowers of the Pala tree. A potpourri of Tamil and Kerala
                  culture, some of the finest Carnatic musicians hail from this
                  district which continues to be a principally agrarian society.

                  Malappuram district has a rich and vibrant history. The
                  military headquarters of the Zamorins of Kozhikode since
                  ancient times, this district was the site for many of the
                  Mappila Revolts (uprising against the British East India
                  Company in Kerala) between 1792 and 1921. Malappuram literally
                  means a land atop hills and the region is enriched by three
                  great rivers flowing through it - the Chaliyar, Kadalundi and
                  the Bharathapuzha. Malappuram has made numerous contributions
                  to the cultural heritage of Kerala. A famous centre for
                  Hindu-Vedic learning and Islamic philosophy, the temples and
                  mosques of this region are well known for their spectacular
                  festivals.Along with historic monuments and diverse natural
                  attractions, a range of cultural and ritual art forms add to
                  its charm as a destination.

                  The legendary seaport where Arab, Chinese and East African
                  traders once converged, Kozhikode was previously the most
                  crucial region of the Malabar Coast. Vasco da Gama landed on
                  its shores in 1498, shooting the region to global fame. Once
                  the capital of the influential Zamorins and a prominent trade
                  and commerce centre, the winds of change have swept over this
                  charming coastal land. The whiff of history continues to
                  permeate the lanes, bazaars and business hubs of Kozhikode.
                  Lush green countryside, serene beaches, historic sites,
                  wildlife sanctuaries, rivers and hills make Kozhikode a
                  popular destination.

                  customs and the festivals here are true celebrations of the

                  temples. This magnificent art form plays an integral part in

                  as Cannanore, Marco Polo christened it a ‘Great Emporium Of
                  Spice Trade’. Kannur has, since time immemorial, been hailed
                  as an influential sea port. Legend has it that it had
                  interactions and trade relations with the rest of the world
                  since the time of King Solomon to the Greeks, Arabs and
                  Romans. It has a plethora of forts, temples, beaches and
                  wildlife sanctuaries that regularly attract visitors. Major
                  festivals and events are held throughout the year and this is
                  among the best places in Kerala to spend your vacation in.
