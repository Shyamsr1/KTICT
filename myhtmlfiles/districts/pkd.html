              Palakkad District the largest district in Kerala from 2006. The
              city of Palakkad is the district headquarters. Palakkad is
              bordered on the northwest by the Malappuram District, on the
              southwest by the Thrissur District, on the northeast by The
              Nilgiris District, and on the east by Coimbatore district of Tamil
              Nadu. The district is 24.4% urbanized according to the census of
              2011. The district is nicknamed "the granary of Kerala". Palakkad
              is the gateway to Kerala due to the presence of the Palakkad Gap,
              in the Western Ghats. Most parts of the district fall in the
              midland region (elevation 75–250 m or 246–820 ft), except the
              Nelliampathy-Parambikulam area in the Chittur taluk in the south
              and Attappadi-Malampuzha area in the north, which are hilly and
              fall in the highland region (elevation > 250 m or 820 ft). The
              climate is pleasant for most parts of the year, the exception is
              the summer months. There is sufficient rainfall and it receives
              more rainfall than the extreme southern districts of Kerala. The
              district is blessed with many small and medium rivers, which are
              tributaries of the Bharathapuzha River. A number of dams have been
              built across these rivers, the largest being the Malampuzha dam.
              The largest in volume capacity is the Parambikulam Dam.

                        Palakkad town of Kerala state, southern India. It was
                        recaptured and rebuilt grandly by Sultan Hyder Ali in
