              Thiruvananthapuram, commonly known by its former name Trivandrum,
              is the capital of the Indian state of Kerala. It is the most
              populous city in Kerala with a population of 957,730 as of 2011.
              The encompassing urban agglomeration population is around 1.68
              million. Located on the west coast of India near the extreme south
              of the mainland, Thiruvananthapuram is a major Information
              Technology hub in Kerala and contributes 55% of the state's
              software exports as of 2016. Referred to by Mahatma Gandhi as the
              "Evergreen city of India", the city is characterised by its
              undulating terrain of low coastal hills. The Ays ruled the present
              region of Thiruvananthapuram until the 10th century. With their
              fall in the 10th century, the city was taken over by the Chera
              dynasty. The city was later taken over by the Kingdom of Venad in
              the 12th century. In the 17th century the king Marthanda Varma
              expanded the territory and founded the princely state of
              Travancore and Thiruvananthapuram was made capital of Travancore.
              Following India's independence in 1947, Thiruvananthapuram became
              the capital of Travancore-Cochin state and remained capital when
              the new Indian state of Kerala was formed in 1956.
              Thiruvananthapuram is a notable academic and research hub and is
              home to the University of Kerala, Kerala Technological University
              the regional headquarters of Indira Gandhi National Open
              University, and many other schools and colleges.
              Thiruvananthapuram is also home to research centres such as the
              National Institute for Interdisciplinary Science and Technology,
              Indian Space Research Organisation's Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre,
              the Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology, and a campus
              of the Indian Institutes of Science Education and Research. The
              city is home to media institutions like Toonz India Ltd and Tata
              Elxsi Ltd, and is also home to Chitranjali Film Studio, one of the
              first film studios in Malayalam Cinema, and Kinfra Film and Video
              Park at Kazhakoottom, which is India's first Infotainment
              industrial park. Being India's largest city in the deep south, it
              is strategically prominent and hosts the Southern Air Command
              headquarters of the Indian Air Force, the Thumba Equatorial Rocket
              Launching Station and the upcoming Vizhinjam International
              Seaport. Thiruvananthapuram is a major tourist centre, known for
              the Padmanabhaswamy Temple, the beaches of Kovalam and Varkala,
              the backwaters of Poovar and Anchuthengu and its Western Ghats
              tracts of Ponmudi and the Agastyamala. In 2012, Thiruvananthapuram
              was named the best Kerala city to live in, by a field survey
              conducted by The Times of India. In 2013, the city was ranked the
              fifteenth best city to live in India, in a survey conducted by
              India Today. The city was also selected as the best-governed city
              in India in the survey conducted by Janaagraha Centre for
              citizenship and democracy in 2017.

                        Locals in the capital city of Thiruvananthapuram will
                        declare that a weekend drive to Ponmudi is among the
                        best ways to spend time in the city. Families and
                        friends alike are known to go on long drives up the
                        winding paths for a view they insist rivals any other in
                        the State. The slopes shrouded in mist fill one with a
                        feeling of wonder and amazement. A large amount of rare
                        flora and fauna can be seen here including mountain
                        flowers, wild orchids and exotic butterflies.
