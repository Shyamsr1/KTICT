            <p class="flow-text">
              The name Ernakulam is derived from Erayanarkulam (Tamil /
              Malayalam) which means the abode of Lord Shiva. Ernakulam was also
              known as "Rishinagakulam" in ancient days. Ernakulam is situated
              in the central part of Kerala. It is home to over 12% of Kerala’s
              population. Its headquarters is located at Kakkanad. Ernakulam
              district includes Kochi city, which is known as the commercial
              capital of Kerala. The district is famous for its ancient temples,
              churches, and mosques. The district includes the largest
              metropolitan region of the state, Greater Cochin. Ernakulam
              district is the highest revenue yielding district and the district
              with most number of industries in the state, and hence called the
              financial, industrial and commercial capital of Kerala. All these
              factors make Ernakulam district to contribute around 60% of the
              annual state revenue. It is the third most populous district in
              Kerala, after Malappuram and Thiruvananthapuram (out of 14).
              Ernakulam district also hosts the highest number of international
              and domestic tourists in Kerala state. Ernakulam became India's
              first district having 100 percent banking or full 'meaningful
              financial inclusion' in 2012. Ernakulam has a very high HDI of
              0.801 (UNHDP report 2005) which is among the highest in India.

                        Marine Drive is a picturesque promenade in the city of
                        Kochi, Kerala, India. It is built facing the backwaters,
                        and is a popular hangout for the local populace. Ironic
                        to its name, no vehicles are allowed on the walkway.
                        Marine Drive is also an economically thriving part of
                        the city of Kochi. With several shopping malls it is as
                        an important centre of shopping activity in Kochi. The
                        view of the setting and rising sun over the sea mouth,
                        and the gentle breeze from the Vembanad Lake has made
                        Marine Drive an important tourist destination in Kochi.
                        The walkway has three contemporary constructed bridges,
                        the Rainbow bridge, the Chinese Fishing Net Bridge and
                        the House Boat Bridge. Hundreds of people (both natives,
                        and tourists) throng the walkway during the evenings.
                        The walkway starts from the High Court Junction and
                        continues until the Rajendra Maidan. There are also
                        several boat jetties along the walkway.
